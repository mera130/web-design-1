  <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating webpages. It structures content like text, images, links, and videos using tags, telling the browser how to display them. It forms the skeleton of a website, while CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity.
    
</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style and design webpages, controlling colors, fonts, layouts, and overall appearance.
</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mainly used to make webpages interactive and dynamic. While HTML gives structure and CSS adds style, JavaScript adds functionality—like handling button clicks, animations, forms, and interactive content. It’s also used beyond the web in areas like mobile apps, game development, and server-side programming</p>


<h2>Python</h2>
<p>Python is a powerful and easy-to-learn programming language that is widely used in many fields, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation. Its simple syntax makes it beginner-friendly, while its vast libraries and frameworks make it useful for building almost anything, from small scripts to complex applications.</p><br>

<p>I really enjoy working with HTML because it allows me to structure and build webpages creatively. It’s interesting to see how tags can shape the content and form the foundation of a website.</p>
